# gero


## Why is gero slightly slower than the website?
Apparently, the RSS feed could be 50% slower than sending a query through the website. 
It is possible that requesting for the HTML document and parsing it could be faster than
requesting for the RSS feed and parsing that. The slight delay does affect the main usage of the
program, but will consider alternatives to speed things up.
